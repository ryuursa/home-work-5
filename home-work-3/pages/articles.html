        <h2>How to Create a Website</h2>
        <p>Creating a website can seem daunting, but with the right approach, it’s easier than you think! Follow these steps to bring your website idea to life:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Choose a Platform:</strong> Decide on a platform for building your site. Popular options include WordPress, Wix, and Squarespace for beginners, or coding it from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for advanced users.</li>
            <li><strong>Pick a Domain Name:</strong> Your domain name is your website’s address (e.g., www.yourwebsite.com). Choose something short, memorable, and relevant to your content.</li>
            <li><strong>Select Web Hosting:</strong> Hosting services like Bluehost, HostGator, or SiteGround store your website files and make them accessible online.</li>
            <li><strong>Design Your Website:</strong> Use templates or design it yourself. Focus on clean navigation, appealing visuals, and responsive design to ensure it looks great on all devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Content:</strong> Create pages like “Home,” “About,” “Contact,” and any other sections your site needs. Use engaging text and high-quality images.</li>
            <li><strong>Test and Launch:</strong> Before going live, test your website for errors, broken links, or formatting issues. Once everything is polished, hit “Publish”!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Is CSS?</h2>
        <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the language used to style websites. It defines how HTML elements appear on a webpage, including layout, colors, fonts, and spacing.</p>
        <p><strong>Why CSS Matters:</strong> Without CSS, websites would look plain and unstructured. CSS allows designers to create visually appealing sites that captivate users.</p>
        <p><strong>How CSS Works:</strong> CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them. For example:</p>
        <pre>
            h1 {
            color: blue;
            font-size: 24px;
            }
        </pre>
        <p>This code makes all h1 headers blue and sets the font size to 24px.</p>

        <h2>SEO Basics for Beginners</h2>
        <p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the process of improving your website’s visibility in search engine results. Here’s a beginner-friendly guide:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keyword Research:</strong> Find out what words or phrases your audience searches for. Use tools like Google Keyword Planner or SEMrush to identify popular terms.</li>
            <li><strong>On-Page SEO:</strong> Optimize your website content by including relevant keywords in titles, headings, and meta descriptions. Ensure each page has a unique focus.</li>
            <li><strong>Quality Content:</strong> Search engines prioritize sites with valuable, original content. Write articles, blogs, or guides that address your audience’s needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile-Friendly Design:</strong> Over half of all web traffic comes from mobile devices. Make sure your site is responsive and works well on all screen sizes.</li>
            <li><strong>Fast Loading Times:</strong> A slow website can hurt your rankings. Compress images, use efficient coding, and consider a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for better speed.</li>
            <li><strong>Backlinks:</strong> Earn links from other reputable websites. Backlinks signal to search engines that your content is trustworthy.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor Performance:</strong> Use tools like Google Analytics to track your traffic and adjust your strategy over time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With consistent effort, SEO can drive more visitors to your site and help you reach a larger audience.</p>
